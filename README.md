## Introduction 
Cavemonster is a Unity game where the player has to collect the treasure situated behind the monster and come back to the starting line.
Player has shield that can be used to block monster's attacks. The monster is controlled by an HTN-based AI with an idle behaviour between 
locations, and two forms of distance attack using crates and rocks, each of which is followed by a 1s cool-down.

### Notes
The project is visually simple as the main goal was to implement the HTN planner.
